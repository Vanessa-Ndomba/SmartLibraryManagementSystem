# Smart Library Management System

## Overview

The Smart Library Management System is a web application I'm developing to assist libraries manage their daily operations more efficiently. The concept started from noticing how frustrating it may be to visit a library only to discover that the book you need is already borrowed, with no convenient method to find out or reserve it ahead of time. This system will allow members to search for books and make reservations, while librarians handle loans, returns, and penalties using a simple web interface. The project will be constructed in phases during the semester, starting with the core foundation and gradually adding functionality until a fully functional system is delivered.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication** — Secure login and registration for Members and Librarians
- **Book Catalogue** — Search, browse, add, edit, and remove books
- **Borrow & Return** — Librarians can issue and process book loans
- **Reservations** — Members can reserve books that are currently borrowed
- **Fine Calculation** — Overdue fines are automatically calculated and displayed on screen
- **Admin Summary** — Simple dashboard showing total books, active loans, and members

## Language Choice and Key Design Decisions

The system is implemented in Java using Spring Boot for the backend. Java was chosen because it is the language I am most comfortable with and Spring Boot makes it straightforward to build REST APIs with built-in security and JPA support.

**Key design decisions in the code:**

- `UserAccount` is an abstract base class that both `Member` and `Librarian` extend, keeping authentication logic in one place
- `Fine` is composed within `Loan` because a fine cannot exist without the loan that generated it
- The `DatabaseConnection` Singleton ensures only one database connection exists at any time
- The `BookBuilder` provides a clean, validated way to construct Book objects with many optional fields

## Creational Pattern Rationales

| Pattern          | Class                 | Rationale                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple Factory   | `UserFactory`         | Centralises user creation so all Member and Librarian objects are created in one place                |
| Factory Method   | `NotificationCreator` | Different notification types are created by specific subclasses without changing the base interface   |
| Abstract Factory | `AccountFactory`      | Ensures Member and Librarian accounts are always created with compatible welcome notifications        |
| Builder          | `BookBuilder`         | Books have many optional fields; the Builder allows step-by-step construction with validation         |
| Prototype        | `BookPrototypeCache`  | Common book templates can be cloned and customised instead of being configured from scratch each time |
| Singleton        | `DatabaseConnection`  | Only one database connection should exist throughout the application to prevent conflicts             |

## Project Structure

```
/src/main/java/domain               — Core class implementations
/src/main/java/creational_patterns  — All six creational design patterns
/src/test/java/tests                — Unit tests for all patterns
```

## Repository Layer

The system uses a repository pattern to abstract all data storage behind interfaces.

### Why Generics
I used a generic `Repository<T, ID>` interface to avoid duplicating CRUD method signatures across every entity repository. Each entity-specific interface like `BookRepository` extends this base interface and adds domain-specific queries like `findByAuthor()` and `findAvailable()`.

### Why Factory Pattern over Dependency Injection
I chose the Factory Pattern over Dependency Injection because it is simpler to implement without a framework like Spring. The `RepositoryFactory` acts as a single place where the storage backend is decided. Switching from in-memory to a database in the future only requires changing the factory, nothing else in the codebase needs to change.

| Storage Type | Implementation |
|-------------|---------------|
| MEMORY | InMemoryBookRepository, InMemoryMemberRepository etc. |
| DATABASE | DatabaseBookRepository (stub — future implementation) |

## Kanban Board Customisation

The project board uses the Automated Kanban template with two additional columns:

| Column  | Purpose                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Testing | Features being validated against acceptance criteria    |
| Blocked | Work that cannot proceed until a dependency is resolved |
